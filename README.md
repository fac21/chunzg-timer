My process

- Write out html first: Make two separate timers in html
- Set up basic code with function for timer and add event listeners
- Googled to see if there is something like Date() for time only, which would allow timer to automatically go to 4:59 from 5:00 without too much code. Referred to Codewars kata dealing with same topic. 
- Try to write out algorithm in the startTimer function and eventually looked up a tutorial to make sure I don’t go down completely wrong path!

Learnings
- Confirm method - similar to alert, but has a cancel as well as ok button. 
- Reinforced setInterval method and how to use with functions
- Assignment and comparison operators very important to know difference
- This exercise forced me to think through logic step by step
- Practice with form/input tags - never used before

Still to do: 
- Dry code - combine into one function with if statements
- Configure the setInterval method of javascript to execute the method immediately and then execute with the timer
